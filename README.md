# Based on Î¼DRAC https://github.com/nickroethemeier/udrac

### IMM KVM Launcher for Windows, Linux and OSX

## Currently Supported

* IBM System X IMM I KVM

## Build Dependencies

* Python 3.10 or greater
* PyInstaller

## Some Important Notes

This GUI launcher is based on "reverse engineered" interactions with the out-of-band management card.

**Absolutly no respect or effort has been made toward security**, and often the password is literally handed to the java
code via argument...

**WARNING**: Due to the nature of connecting to OOB server management, *ALL SSL ISSUES ARE BYPASSED AND IGNORED*

## Extra Important License Notes

This launcher package contains code from MANY sources including

* Java JRE, from Sun Microsystems / Oracle
* IBM Video Viewer KVM / Avocent Corporation

These external libraries are included as part simply because they are annoying to acquire. If anyone cares please let me
know.
